  "keywords": <array of strings>
}

RULES:
- label: 3 to 8 words, human-readable, not too broad, not too technical.

I really feel the need for a knowledgable hockey observer to explain this year's playoffs to me. I mean, the obviously superior Toronto team with the best center and the best goalie in the league keeps losing. What gives? -- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I stand by all the misstatements that I've made. -- Vice President Dan Quayle to Sam Donaldson, 8/17/89

What are the Leafs to do? I am a Leaf supporter and I say the Leafs are going down in four unless there is nothing short of a miracle or a stroke of genenius hits Pat Burns. If you were Pat Burns what would you do? Living in the Bay area, I do not get enough Leaf coverage to pull something out of the bag, (I would appreciate comments on the Leaf/Detroit 3rd line match-ups) but here is the basic idea... Andreychuck and Borchevsky have no business playing against the Wings. They are too small. The key to any Leafs success will have to be Clark. He is the only centre who can have any presence wit

We're probably stuck, as Mike Burger pointed out that the baseball deal was made far in advance of the NHL contract. WABC did the same thing; they were thankful that the Devils were wiped out by 9:30, because they had to switch over to Yankees baseball. The proof of the reasons for this is left to the reader ... It's too bad, but I wonder if ESPN is stuck with other US local team coverage for their alternate games? We got NESN's coverage of the Bruins-Sabres with the Boston homers ... they were awful!!! I've read that Derek Sanderson is the colour analyst ... I wonder if he spent his early yea

Never was? Probably. Is not now? Debatable. What other valid test can you think of besides the final standings or divisional playoff winner? What do you propose, a worthless vote like they do in college football? What a joke! If I remember right, Brad Park was also involved in that trade. He wasn't all that bad a hockey player. But let's look at some of Sinden's trades over the years: ??? for Rick Middleton (Rangers). I don't know who Sinden gave up for Middle- ton, so I'll call this one a +. Barry Pederson for Cam Neely (Canucks). +++. Any questions? Greg Hawgood for Vladimir Ruzicka (Oilers)

I think this guy is going to be just a little bit disappointed. Lemieux two, Tocchet, Mullen, Tippett, and Jagr. I buzzed my friend because I forgot who had scored Mullen's goal. I said, "Who scored? Lemieux two, Tocchet, Tippett, Jagr." The funny part was I said the "Jagr" part non-chalantly as he was in the process of scoring while I was asking this question!!! :-) All in all ABC's coverage wasn't bad. On a scale of 1-10, I give it about an 8. How were the games in the Chi/St. Louis/LA area??? That's stupid!!! I'd complain to the television network! If I were to even see a Pirates game on in

Since everyone else seems to be running wild with predictions, I've decided to add my own fuel to the fire: They might seem a bit normal, but there are a few (albeit, small) surprises.
