  "label": <string>,
  "rationale": <string>,
  "keywords": <array of strings>
}

RULES:
- label: 3 to 8 words, human-readable, not too broad, not too technical.
- rationale: 1-2 sentences explaining why the label fits the documents.
- keywords: 5-10 keywords or keyphrases (strings), derived from the content.

Nor, to point out the obvious, are the deluded, siege-mentality followers of a religious nut-case who thought he was Jesus Christ or possibly The Big Guy. Personally, much as I regard the BATF and FBI as ConDupes, I'll take their word over a bunch of silly pinks who were stoopid enough to lock themselves up with a goofball like "David Koresh" in a makeshift arsenal. ************************************************************ * The_Doge of South St. Louis * * Dobbs-Approved Media Conspirator(tm) * * "One Step Beyond" -- Sundays, 3 to 5 pm * * 88.1 FM St. Louis Community Radio * * "You'll pay t

At first this kind of ranting annoyed me, but now it's rather entertaining. These kinds of posts don't require ANY facts, logic, or even sense. It's kind of like what 10-year old kids do on the playground. So go on and play. Not everyone on the net is as simple minded as you guys seem to be. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ "Nothing is as inevitable as a mistake whose time has Garrett Johnson come." --Tussman Garrett@Ingres.com "The probability of someone watching you is proportional to the stupidity of your action." - Unknown

I addressed most of the key issues in this very long (284 lines) post by Dean Kaflowitz in two posts yesterday. The first was made into the title post of a new thread, "Is Dean Kaflowitz terminally irony-impaired?" and the second, more serious one appeared along the thread "A Chaney Post, and a Challenge, reissued and revised" both only in talk.abortion, but I am posting its contents into talk.religion.misc as soon as I exit here. This should be enough for us to thrash out for the next week or so. The second post really grapples with the main bones of contention between us. The first is more l

I responded to Jim's other articles today, but I see that I neglected to respond to this one. I wouldn't want him to think me a hypocrite for not responding to *every* stupid article on t.r.m. [dictionary definitions of "not" "disagree" and "agree" deleted] Oh, but I'm weary of trying to wade through Jim's repertoire of red herrings and smoke screens. Let's see what we get when we run all four articles posted by Jim today through the 'discord' filter (a Markov chain program that Steve Lamont was kind enough to send me): Taking action? A white geese be held as an accomplice to be held as a deci

Your last remark is a contradiction, but I'll let that pass. I was addressing the notion of the Great Commission, which you deleted in order to provide us with dull little homilies. Thank you, Bing Crosby. Now you go right on back to sleep and mommy and daddy will tuck you in later. Oh, and how convenient his bible must have been to Michael Griffin, how convenient his Christianity. "Well, I'll just skip the bit about not murdering people and loving the sinner and hating the sin and all that other stuff for now and concentrate on the part where it says that if someone is doing something wrong,

Another dodge. Oh well. I'm no match for your amazing repertoire of red herrings and smoke screens. You asked for an apology. I'm not going to apologize for pointing out that your straw-man argument was a straw-man argument. Nor for saying that your list of "bible contradictions" shows such low standards of scholarship that it should be an embarrassment to anti-inerrantists, just as Josh McDowell should be an embarrassment to the fundies. Nor for objecting various times to your taking quotes out of context. Nor for pointing out that "they do it too" is not an excuse. Nor for calling your red h
