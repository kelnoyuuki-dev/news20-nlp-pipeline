I would like to sell my PS/2 Model 50, with its Kingston SX/Now! 33MHz processor, a Cyrix FasMath coprocessor (CPU/FPU LandMark scores of 46.6MHz/107.8MHz), 8 Meg (9 Meg total) on a AST Advantage/2 board (0 wait state), original 20 Meg hard drive, and a very fast Adaptec 1640 SCSI controller card (worth around $300 new) with software to control any external or internal SCSI device.
